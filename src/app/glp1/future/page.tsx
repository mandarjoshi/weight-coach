        The Future of GLP-1 Drugs
      </h3>

      <p>
        As research continues to evolve, the future of GLP-1 receptor agonists looks
        incredibly promising â€” not only for managing diabetes and obesity but for
        a wide range of metabolic and chronic conditions.
      </p>

      <h4 style={{ color: '#1e6091', marginTop: '15px' }}>ðŸ”¬ Microdosing Strategies</h4>
      <p>
        Researchers are exploring <strong>microdosing</strong> GLP-1 drugs to achieve
        therapeutic benefits with fewer side effects. This could improve tolerability
        for patients who struggle with nausea or gastrointestinal symptoms, and may
        open the door to preventive, low-dose therapies for metabolic health.
      </p>

      <h4 style={{ color: '#1e6091', marginTop: '15px' }}>ðŸ’Š Oral and Long-Acting Formulations</h4>
      <p>
        While many GLP-1 drugs are injectable, companies are developing
        <strong> oral versions</strong> and <strong>once-monthly injections</strong> to improve
        convenience and adherence. Rybelsus is already an oral GLP-1 option, and
        more are on the horizon.
      </p>

      <h4 style={{ color: '#1e6091', marginTop: '15px' }}>ðŸ§¬ Combination Therapies</h4>
      <p>
        Next-generation drugs will likely combine GLP-1 with other hormones like
        <strong> GIP</strong> and <strong>glucagon</strong> to enhance metabolic effects. Some of these,
        like tirzepatide (Mounjaro), are already approved and showing even greater
        weight loss potential.
      </p>

      <h4 style={{ color: '#1e6091', marginTop: '15px' }}>ðŸ§  Beyond Diabetes & Obesity</h4>
      <p>
        There is growing interest in the use of GLP-1 drugs for treating conditions
        like <strong>fatty liver disease (NAFLD/NASH)</strong>, <strong>addiction</strong>, and even
        <strong>neurodegenerative diseases</strong> like Alzheimers. The impact of GLP-1 on inflammation,
        appetite regulation, and insulin signaling may have wide-reaching implications.
      </p>

      <p style={{ fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#555', marginTop: '20px' }}>
        ðŸš€ GLP-1 therapies are rapidly transforming from glucose-lowering agents
        into powerful tools for full-body metabolic health â€” and we are just getting started.
